                From the chart we can see all of the positions that Lando finished througout the 2019 F1 season. A season best of 6th at both Bahrain and Austria and a season worst of 18th in China. At the beginning of the season we can see quite high variance in positions whereas towards the end  the variance goes down a lot and in the last three races we can see he only finished in either 7th or 8th.

                For 2020 we can see that the variance has actually increased especially around the middle of the season. With a season worst of 15th he has improved on his worst from 2019 and has become much more consistent at the high end of the positions. A season best of 3rd in Austria locked up his first podium in the sport as well as two 4ths and three 5ths shows that he has improved tremendously with these 6 results being better that his best result over the previous year.
